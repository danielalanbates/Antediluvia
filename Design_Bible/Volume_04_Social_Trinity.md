# ANTEDILUVIA DESIGN BIBLE - VOLUME IV: THE SOCIAL TRINITY & CLASS SYSTEM

**Version:** 1.0 Alpha
**Philosophy:** "Iron Sharpens Iron"
**Structure:** Classless Base -> Archetype Mastery

---

## 1. The Social Mandate

In *Antediluvia*, the "Lone Wolf" dies. The world is designed to be mathematically hostile to solo players beyond the safety of the city walls.

### 1.1 The "Pack Tactics" AI
*   **Mechanic:** All hostile mobs (even animals) share a hive-mind awareness within a radius.
*   **Example:** If you shoot an arrow at a Wolf, it does not just charge you. It howls. Two other wolves flank you from the left and right.
*   **HP Scaling:** An "Even-Con" (same level) mob has 300% the HP of a player and deals 20% of a player's max HP per hit.
*   **Result:** You *need* a Tank to hold attention and a Healer to mend the damage.

## 2. The Classless Progression

Players begin as **Wanderers**. There is no character creation screen where you pick "Mage" or "Warrior." You are simply a human of the line of Adam.

### 2.1 Stat Growth
*   Stats (Strength, Wisdom, Agility) increase by **Use**.
    *   Swing a hammer -> Strength increases.
    *   Read ancient tablets -> Wisdom increases.
    *   Run/Climb -> Agility increases.

### 2.2 Unlocking Archetypes
Classes are not chosen; they are **revealed**. To unlock a class, you must perform a "Feat of Legend" that attracts the attention of a Hidden Trainer (Master).

## 3. The Five Archetypes (The Trinity)

### 3.1 The Shepherd (The Tank)
*   **Lineage:** House of Abel / Davidic Tradition.
*   **Unlock Condition:** Defend a "Defenseless NPC" (like a sheep or child) from a predator for 5 minutes. You must take hits without the NPC dying.
*   **Weaponry:** Staff, Sling, Club.
*   **Core Mechanic:** **The Rebuke**.
    *   The Shepherd does not "taunt" with magic. He shouts biblical rebukes ("You shall not pass!", "Back, beast!").
    *   This generates **Enmity** (Aggro).
*   **Ultimate:** "The 23rd Psalm." A channeled aura where the Shepherd becomes immune to fear and reduces damage taken by 80% for the party.

### 3.2 The Levite (The Healer)
*   **Lineage:** The Priesthood (Prophetic anticipation).
*   **Unlock Condition:** Find a "Dying Stranger" event in the wilderness. Instead of looting them, apply herbs and bandages until they recover.
*   **Weaponry:** Censer (Incense burner), Dagger (Ceremonial).
*   **Core Mechanic:** **Incense & Atonement**.
    *   Healing is not "Mana" based; it is Resource based. You must craft specific Incense blends.
    *   Burning "Frankincense" heals over time.
    *   Burning "Myrrh" cures poisons.
*   **Risk:** The smoke attracts predators. Healing generates high Enmity.

### 3.3 The Nephilim Hunter (Melee DPS)
*   **Lineage:** House of the Mighty (Nimrod archetype).
*   **Unlock Condition:** Deal >50% of the damage to a "Giant" class enemy in a group setting.
*   **Weaponry:** Two-Handed Bronze Spears, Greatswords.
*   **Core Mechanic:** **Momentum**.
    *   Each hit increases attack speed. Stopping movement resets Momentum.
    *   "Giant Slayer": Bonus damage based on how much larger the enemy is than the player.

### 3.4 The Disciple of the Forge (Burst DPS/Utility)
*   **Lineage:** House of Tubal-Cain (Redeemed).
*   **Unlock Condition:** Craft a weapon of "Masterwork" quality and present it to the Forge Master in the Outskirts.
*   **Weaponry:** Hammers, Fire Pots (Grenades).
*   **Core Mechanic:** **Heat**.
    *   Weapons build up heat. At Max Heat, special attacks deal fire damage but damage the weapon's durability.
    *   Can repair party armor in the field.

### 3.5 The Psalmist (Support/Buffer)
*   **Lineage:** House of Jubal (Redeemed).
*   **Unlock Condition:** Craft a Lyre and play a perfect rhythm mini-game at a campfire, giving the "Rested" buff to 5 players.
*   **Weaponry:** Lyre, Bow.
*   **Core Mechanic:** **Songs of Ascent**.
    *   The Psalmist plays music (Guitar Hero style rhythm inputs).
    *   As long as the song plays, the party gains buffs (Speed, Stamina Regen, Fear Immunity).
    *   The Psalmist cannot attack while playing.

## 4. Party Synergy (Skill Chains)

Combat is not just spamming buttons. It requires **Resonance**.

*   **The Chain:**
    1.  Player A (Hunter) uses "Thrust".
    2.  A 3-second window opens.
    3.  Player B (Forge) uses "Smash".
    4.  **Effect:** "Shatter" Resonance occurs. Massive AOE damage.
*   **Communication:** Players must talk. "Opening with Thrust!" "Closing with Smash!"
