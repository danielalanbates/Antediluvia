## 1. The History of the World

The world is young, yet ancient. It is the tenth generation of mankind. The echoes of the Garden of Eden are still felt—the Cherubim's sword is visible on the horizon. Humans live for hundreds of years, but the shadow of death is growing.

### 1.1 The Great Divide
Humanity has split into two distinct cultures, physically and spiritually separated.

**The Line of Seth (The Sons of God)**
*   **Philosophy:** They "call upon the name of the Lord" (Genesis 4:26). They value stewardship, simplicity, and waiting for the Prophecy (the Seed of the Woman).
*   **Location:** The Highlands and the Gopher Wood Forests.
*   **Aesthetic:** Stone, wood, white linens, natural integration. They build *with* the land.
*   **Leadership:** The Patriarchs (Methuselah, Lamech, Noah).

**The Line of Cain (The Sons of Men)**
*   **Philosophy:** "We shall make a name for ourselves." They value progress, conquest, urbanism, and defying the Curse.
*   **Location:** The City of Enoch (East of Eden).
*   **Aesthetic:** Bronze, Iron, Obsidian, Red dyes. Industrial, smoky, sharp angles.
*   **Leadership:** The Tubal-Cain Industrial Complex.

## 2. The Watchers & The Corruption

Based on the Book of Enoch, the "Corruption" is not just human sin; it is an external infection brought by the **Watchers** (Fallen Angels).

### 2.1 The Descent
Two hundred angels descended onto Mount Hermon. They took human wives and taught forbidden arts:
*   **Azazel:** Taught men to make swords, knives, and shields (Warfare).
*   **Semjaza:** Taught enchantments and root-cuttings (Sorcery).
*   **Baraqijal:** Taught astrology (Fatalism).

### 2.2 The Forbidden Knowledge
In the game, this manifests as "Tech."
*   **Cosmetics:** Painting the eyes and face (taught by the Watchers) is a mark of the House of Cain.
*   **Metallurgy:** Advanced alloys are "Cainite" tech. Sethites use simpler bronze or wood, relying on faith for power.

## 3. The Nephilim (The Giants)

The offspring of the Watchers and human women. They are the primary antagonists.

*   **Physiology:** 9 to 12 feet tall (Generation 1). Later generations are smaller but more numerous.
*   **Nature:** They possess insatiable hunger. They consume all resources—crops, animals, and eventually men.
*   **Culture:** They are worshipped as "Heroes of Old, Men of Renown" in the City of Enoch. They act as overlords/tyrants.

## 4. The Prophecy of the Seed

The "House of Seth" is driven by a singular hope: **The Proto-Evangelium** (Genesis 3:15).
*   *"He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel."*
*   **The Expectation:** The Sethites believe a Deliverer is coming. Many thought it was Noah (whose name means "Rest").
*   **The Twist:** Noah is not the Messiah; he is the Ark-Builder. The *true* Messiah is a distant vision seen only in the "Ladder of Bethel."
