**Version:** 1.0 Alpha
**Focus:** NPCs, World Events, Bestiary

---

## 1. Key Figures (NPCs)

These entities are the pillars of the narrative. They are not static quest givers; they are agents with schedules and goals.

### 1.1 Noah (The Builder)
*   **Role:** The Anchor of Reality.
*   **Location:** The Clearing in the Gopher Wood.
*   **Behavior:**
    *   He does not speak to players. He is too focused.
    *   Animation Loop: He fells trees. He drags timber. He boils pitch. He preaches "Righteousness" (audible sermons) to the empty air or to heckling crowds.
*   **Interaction:** Players can "Donate" Gopher Wood to his pile. This slightly speeds up the Ark's visual progress bar.

### 1.2 Methuselah (The Oldest Man)
*   **Role:** The Loremaster.
*   **Location:** A cave near the entrance to the Highlands.
*   **Behavior:** He sits in silence.
*   **Interaction:** If a player sits with him for 5 real-time minutes without moving, he speaks a "Proverb."
*   **Knowledge:** He is the only NPC who remembers Adam personally. He can answer questions about the Garden with first-hand authority.

### 1.3 Tubal-Cain (The Master of the Forge)
*   **Role:** The Tempter / Antagonist Leader.
*   **Location:** The Great Foundry in Enoch.
*   **Behavior:** He offers players "Power."
*   **Interaction:** He sells the best weapons in the game (High DPS), but equipping them increases your "Corruption" stat, making Sethite NPCs refuse to talk to you.

## 2. The Bestiary (Antediluvian Fauna)

The animals of this era are larger, fiercer, and more primal.

### 2.1 The Behemoth (Raid Boss)
*   **Biblical Ref:** Job 40.
*   **Description:** A sauropod-like creature ("tail like a cedar").
*   **Location:** The River Delta of Havilah.
*   **Mechanic:** It is neutral unless provoked. If attacked, it requires 40+ players to take down. It has "Stoneskin" (high armor).

### 2.2 The Leviathan (World Event)
*   **Biblical Ref:** Job 41.
*   **Description:** A massive sea serpent in the encircling ocean.
*   **Role:** The World Boundary Enforcer. Any player trying to swim too far from the continent is eaten.

### 2.3 Corruption Beasts
*   Animals twisted by Nephilim sorcery.
*   **Chimeras:** Lions with eagle wings, Bulls with human faces.
*   **Behavior:** Highly aggressive. They hunt players actively, tracking scent over kilometers.

## 3. World Events

### 3.1 The Nephilim Raids
*   **Trigger:** Random or high Corruption levels.
*   **Event:** A war-band of Giants descends from the mountains to burn a Sethite village or attack the Ark site.
*   **Objective:** Players must form a defensive line. Tanks hold the Giants; DPS target the knees.
*   **Fail State:** If the village burns, that vendor is gone for the real-time week.

### 3.2 The Preaching of Noah
*   **Trigger:** Every Sunday (Server Time).
*   **Event:** Noah stops building. He stands on the ramp of the Ark and delivers a sermon (generated via LLM based on 2 Peter 2:5 "Preacher of Righteousness").
*   **Effect:** Players within earshot receive the "Conviction" buff (+Spirit Regen) or "Guilt" debuff (if they have high Corruption).

### 3.3 Jacob's Ladder (The Vision)
*   **Trigger:** Sleeping in Bethel.
*   **Visual:** The sky peels back. A staircase of light connects Earth to Heaven.
*   **Experience:** The player enters a "Dream State." They see flashes of the future (The Flood, The Cross, The New Jerusalem).
*   **Reward:** "Prophetic Insight" talent point.
