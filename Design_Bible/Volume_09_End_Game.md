## 2. The Final Event: The 100% Moment

When the meter hits 100%, the **End Game Protocol** triggers. This is a one-time server event.

### 2.1 The Fountains of the Deep
*   **Visual:** Geysers erupt from the ground. The ocean level begins to rise physically (Y-axis water plane moves up).
*   **The Timer:** Players have roughly 7 Real-Time Days before the water covers the highest peaks.

### 2.2 The Siege of the Ark
*   **The Conflict:** The Nephilim Army (and Cainite Players) launch a desperate assault to board or destroy the Ark.
*   **The Defense:** Sethite Players and Noah must hold the ramp.
*   **The Mechanic:**
    *   **Sethites:** Must "Load" the animals (escort quests).
    *   **Cainites:** Try to burn the hull.

### 2.3 The Door Closes
*   **The Climax:** God shuts the door (Genesis 7:16).
*   **The Fate:**
    *   Those inside the Ark (or "Saved" via gameplay metrics): Survive to the "New World" (Server Reset/New Season).
    *   Those outside: Perish. Their characters are "Dead."
*   **Legacy:** Surviving characters pass on a "Lineage Trait" to the next character created in the new cycle.
