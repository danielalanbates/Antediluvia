# ANTEDILUVIA DESIGN BIBLE - VOLUME VIII: THE ECONOMY & CRAFTING

**Version:** 1.0 Alpha
**Philosophy:** "By the Sweat of Your Brow"
**System:** Barter & Resource Scarcity

---

## 1. The Resource Economy

There is no "Gold Coin" that drops from wolves. The economy is based on **Materials** and **Utility**.

### 1.1 Currency: Shekels & Barter
*   **The Shekel:** A weight of silver/gold. It is not a UI number. It is an item in your bag.
*   **Usage:** Used primarily in the City of Enoch (House of Cain).
*   **Barter:** The House of Seth prefers barter. "I will give you 10 Wool Bundles for 1 Bronze Knife."

### 1.2 Gathering Professions
Every player can gather, but skill determines yield.
1.  **Shepherding:** Raising sheep for Wool and Milk. Requires defending the flock.
2.  **Husbandry (Farming):** Growing Grain, Flax, and Herbs. Dependent on Weather/Soil quality.
3.  **Mining:** Extracting Copper, Tin, and Gold from the earth.
4.  **Hewing:** Cutting Gopher Wood (Requires Sethite reputation).

## 2. The Crafting System (The Forge)

Crafting is a mini-game, not a progress bar.

### 2.1 Metallurgy (Tubal-Cain's Art)
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Smelt:** Player must manually operate bellows (rhythmic clicking) to keep heat in the "Green Zone."
    2.  **Pour:** Pour molten metal into a mold.
    3.  **Hammer:** Place the hot blade on the anvil. Strike specific points to remove impurities.
*   **Quality:**
    *   *Slag:* Failed timing. Brittle weapon.
    *   *Bronze:* Standard.
    *   *Iron:* Rare. Requires high heat.
    *   *Meteoric:* Forged from "Star Metal" (Fallen Watcher tech). Extremely powerful but corrupting.

### 2.2 Weaving & Tailoring
*   **Process:** Using a loom. Pattern matching mini-game.
*   **Output:** Tunics, Cloaks, Bandages.
*   **Importance:** "Ephods" and "Priestly Garments" provide Spiritual Defense against Corruption.

### 2.3 The Ark Contribution
*   **The Ultimate Sink:** The server's economy revolves around the Ark.
*   **Donations:** Players donate Tar (Pitch), Gopher Wood, and Food stores to the Ark site.
*   **Reward:** No gold. The reward is the "Favor of the Lord" buff and ensuring the Ark is ready for the End Game.

## 3. Degradation & Repair

*   **Entropy:** All items degrade.
*   **Visuals:** Swords get chipped. Tunics get tattered.
*   **Repair:** Requires a whetstone or patch kit.
*   **Breaking:** If an item hits 0 durability, it is destroyed. Nothing lasts forever (except the Soul).
